# Easy Chat Template

A modern chat interface for interacting with AI models.

## Available Models

Currently, the application supports two OpenAI models:

1. **GPT-3.5 Turbo** (`gpt-3.5-turbo`)

   - Fast and efficient for most tasks
   - Default model when using environment API key

2. **GPT-4o** (`gpt-4o`)
   - Most capable model for complex tasks
   - Can be added as an additional model

## Setting Up

There are two ways to add your API key:

### Option 1: Using Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # or gpt-4o
```

### Option 2: Adding Models in the App

1. Click the settings icon in the chat interface
2. Click "Add New Model"
3. Select your desired model (GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4o)
4. Enter your OpenAI API key
5. Click "Add Model"

## Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional): Your OpenAI API key. If provided, it will be used as the default API key.
- `DEFAULT_MODEL` (optional): The default model to use. Options: `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`

### API Key Management

You can provide the API key in two ways:

1. Environment variable (recommended for production)
2. Browser storage (user can input via settings)

### Models Configuration

The template supports two models out of the box:

- GPT-3.5 Turbo: Fast and cost-effective
- GPT-4: More capable but more expensive

You can modify the available models in `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx`.

## Customization

### Styling

The template uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Main style files:

- `src/app/globals.css`: Global styles
- `tailwind.config.ts`: Tailwind configuration

### Components

Key components you might want to customize:

- `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`: Main chat interface
- `src/components/MessageInput.tsx`: Message input component
- `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx`: Settings modal

### API Routes

API endpoints are located in `src/app/api/`:

- `chat/route.ts`: Handles chat messages
- `check-api-key/route.ts`: Verifies API keys

## Security Considerations

1. Never commit your `.env` file
2. Use environment variables for API keys in production
3. Implement rate limiting for API routes
4. Add authentication if needed

## Browser Support

The template supports all modern browsers:

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
